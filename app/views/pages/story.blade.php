                Jess and Sam met during new student orientation their first year at Grinnell College.  They were soon fast friends and supported each other through late night study sessions, grilled-cheese making, and many, many costume parties.  Sam shares a birthday with Jess’ mom, Linda (and the moon landing), and spent many birthdays with the Walther-Cheney household before they began dating.  After five years of friendship, and numerous events attended as platonic “plus ones” for each other, they decided to jump in feet first.  No one was surprised.  Four years later, they have two lovely cats, Molly and Toby, have played innumerable board games, watched or played in countless hours of roller derby, and enjoyed the heck out of life together.  They are thrilled to invite you to their home for their wedding ceremony.
